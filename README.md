# Simplify-B2B-Dashboard
This repository contains a collection of my full-stack web development projects built using a variety of modern technologies and frameworks. The projects include:

Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel
Databases: SQL Server, MongoDB
APIs: RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend.

Each project showcases my ability to work with full-stack solutions, integrating databases and APIs for complete web applications.
The goal of these projects is to create fully functional, efficient, and user-friendly web applications that demonstrate a seamless integration of all components.
